# NewsApp

This is a News App, consisting of two screens. The first is a list of News fetched from the API and second is article screen where you can read the individual articles.

You can also bookmark and save the news articles of your choice in your phone to read them later.

The app follows the MVVM architecture and is made out of Jetpack Compose. The tech stack used in the app is:

MVVM, Android, Jetpack Compose, Navigation, Retrofit, ROOM, View Model, Coroutines, Flow

Future Work to be done:

- The next steps include adding the MVI Orbit library in architecture, adding pagination, Bottom Navigation Bar to access different screens of the app easily. 
- I also want to integrate another Weather App in this that I have made to access the Weather News of the current location.
